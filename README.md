Lightbox
========

This is a fork of Benjamin Donoghue's [Lightbox](http://registry.gimp.org/node/18440) Gimp plugin, with very minor modifications to better suit my workflow.

Difference with original:

 - Saves to PNG instead of TIFF.
 - Mnemonics for all menu items, made them more accessible with keyboard.
